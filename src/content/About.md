# ðŸ”Ž About Farpy

Farpy is a gamified GPU grid â€” part ritual system, part real economy.  
We built it because the internet was boring, and GPU power deserves to be sacred.

**Built by operators. Powered by NodeMonks. Blessed by Chaos.**

CoolBeansâ„¢ is our premium in-game currency. USD is what NodeMonks take home.

**Farpy is not a crypto project. It's a chaos-powered engine for creators and grinders.**
