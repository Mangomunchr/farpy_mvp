# ðŸ“œ Codex of Farpy

**NodeMonks** â€” the patient gridkeepers. Bound by uptime, discipline, and burn rituals.  
**Rendars** â€” the wild channelers. XP-seekers who pay in CoolBeans to awaken the grid.

**Renderlings** â€” the unborn. Curious. Chaotic. Unrefined.

## ðŸ’  The Vault
The Vault is the heartbeat of the network. It pulses with value, risk, and chaos.  
Rituals unlock its favor. XP earns its trust.

---

## ðŸ§¿ Chaos Engine
At random, chaos rituals will descend.  
Only those prepared â€” with beans, XP, and soul â€” may enter.

**Legacy is not given. It is burned into you.**
