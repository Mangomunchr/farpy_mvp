# 🧠 Welcome to Farpy

A vault-powered XP economy. GPU ritual network. Mythic-tier competition.  
You are either a NodeMonk, a Rendar... or a legend waiting to burn.

## 🌱 What is Farpy?
Farpy is a gamified GPU-powered render and XP ecosystem where:

- 🎮 Rendars spend CoolBeans™ to unlock speed, chaos, and role upgrades
- 💻 NodeMonks run jobs, earn real cash, and protect the Vault
- 🧿 Chaos rituals unlock new powers, modes, and legacy rank

## 💸 Real Cash. Real Power.
NodeMonks earn **USD**, not fake points.  
Rendars spend **CoolBeans™**, a real premium token (but not crypto).

## 🚀 Get Started:
1. Login → Choose NodeMonk or Rendar
2. Start earning XP
3. Unlock legacy roles and burn for power

## ⚔️ Vault Opens Weekly
The Vault will unleash blessings every Sunday.  
Only the loyal, online, and ascended shall receive.

Welcome to the fire.
